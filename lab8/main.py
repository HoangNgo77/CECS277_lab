"""
Rad Racer - main program loop

Builds a 3 x 100 track, places two obstacles per lane, shows the menu, asks the
player to choose a vehicle, then runs the race until all three vehicles finish.

Track symbols:
- '-' empty track
- '0' obstacle
- '*': previously occupied location(s)
- 'P' player's vehicle (whichever type)
- 'C', 'M', 'T' are opponents' initials for Car, Motorcycle, and Truck

Important details matched to the handout:
- 3 lanes (Car, Motorcycle, Truck)  100 units (pages 1â€“2).
- Two random obstacles per lane, not at start (0) or finish (99) (page 2).
- Opponents choose moves by weights: slow 40%, fast 30%, special 30%,
  but if energy < 5 they are forced to go slow (page 2).
- Use list.index('0', start) to find next obstacle, with ValueError handling (page 2).
- Place a '*' where a vehicle was, and put its initial at the new location (page 2).
- Keep and report 1st/2nd/3rd place (page 2).
- Do not place outside the list when a vehicle passes the finish (page 6, h).
